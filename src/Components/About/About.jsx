            My tech journey began at York University. My professional path in
            the tech world started in January 2023 at theScore in Toronto, where
            I jumped into the role of a Quality Engineering Intern.

            Concurrently, I worked at Fibra Inc. as a Software Developer,
            leading the development of their beta app, which was both
            challenging and rewarding.
          </p>

            Currently, I am serving as a Business Analyst at CIBC, where I've
            been instrumental in enhancing fraud detection, reducing operational
            losses by a significant 30%. This role has allowed me to apply my
            analytical skills in a real-world financial environment,
            contributing to safer and more efficient banking operations.
          </p>
          <p>
            Outside of these roles, my passion for tech continues through
            personal projects like the development of the yuHacks 2023 website
            and an innovative API Generator. These projects not only supplement
            my professional experiences but also fuel my creativity and
            problem-solving skills.
